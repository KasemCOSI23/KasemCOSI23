## Welcome to My GitHub!
Currently, I am a Master's student (University of Eastern Finland) with an Erasmus Mundus master‚Äôs degree scholarship specializing in Computational Colour and Spectral Imaging . As an AI enthusiast, I honed my artificial intelligence skills through an apprenticeship with experts in the Super AI Engineer program, organized by the Artificial Intelligence Association of Thailand‚Äîone of the top AI programs in the country. Additionally, I gained valuable data science experience as an intern with the technology arm of KASIKORN BANK (KBank), one of Thailand‚Äôs leading commercial banks. To satisfy my passion in this area, I‚Äôm looking for job opportunities in the fields of data scientist and Remote sensing.

### Current 
- **Project Focus:** I'm currently focus on Computer vision, deep learning, HyperSpectral Imaging and image processing.
- **Learning Journey:** Through the journey in COSI program (Computational Colour and Spectral Imaging), I have developed my skill set of data science with RGB and hyperspectral image

### üõ†Ô∏è Languages and Tools

- **Python:** I use Python as the main software Language.
- **TensorFlow:** A key framework in my toolbox for implementing deep learning algorithms.
- **Pytorch:**
- **MATLAB:**
